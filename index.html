                <h2 class="content-subhead">About me</h2>

                <p>Born and raised in CA all her life. </p>
                <p>Loves sports, what sports unable to play, self taught about and became a referee instead. Outdoor has always been her Zen spot. Learned at a young age how to fissh, hunt, hiking, archery, bird watching, swimming, boating, water skiing, diving, and sitting at beach watching people/waves. God keeps me centered. My family gives me love. Job keeps me alive and gives me lots to do. My Zen is where I am close to God. Where I can hear his whispers. </p>
                <p>Reading novels is not my style but give me a research paper and I am off running. Cross checking everything, deciding what stats need revisited and what variables should have been identified. When my first grandson was born I learned why I was placed in this field. See my grandson was non-verbal autistic. I started working with him and gathered all the information I could. This research helped me to assist giving proper tools to my grandson. He is now a functioning and in school. I am proud
                of all he has learned and can not wait to see what life has for him next.</p>
